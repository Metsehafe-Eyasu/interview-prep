# Interview-Prep

A central hub for interview prep at various tech companies. Our site (built with MkDocs) includes:

- **Guides** for each company (how interviews are structured, what to expect).
- **Technical** (LeetCode-style) questions.
- **System Design** questions.
- **Behavioral** (STAR-based) questions.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Metsehafe-Eyasu/Interview-Prep.git
   ```
2. Install MkDocs locally (Python 3 required):

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

3. Run the local server:

```bash
    mkdocs serve
```

> Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Contributing

See HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md for guidelines on:

- Adding a new company folder.
