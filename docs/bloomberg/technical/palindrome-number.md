# Palindrome Number

> [LeetCode Problem: Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## Question

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Examples**:

- `121` -> True
- `-121` -> False (the minus sign is read differently)
- `10` -> False

## Key Points

1. **Constraints**:
   - Typically, the integer can be negative, zero, or positive.
2. **Approach**:
   - Convert to string and check reversed version.
   - Or reverse the integer mathematically.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Negative numbers are not palindromes (by definition in most solutions).
